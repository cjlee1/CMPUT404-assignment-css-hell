        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scepticism is as
        much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of scepticism. To be
        content with what we at present know, is, for the most part, to shut
        our ears against conviction; since, from the very gradual character
        of our education, we must continually forget, and emancipate
        ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set aside old
        notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be daily
        unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety
        to acquire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And this
        difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress
        has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which persons
        and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu of
        their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away
        traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the
        revenues of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from
        attractive superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in
        society. The credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another,
        finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the
        healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams
        of conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the
        Church. History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively
        recent times, are subjected to very different handling from that
        which the indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere
        statements are jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form
        as important an ingredient in the analysis of his history, as the
        facts he records. Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and
        it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical
        evidence is sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting
        in its demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than
        mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended
        experience, is the best help to the criticism of human history.
        Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which
        human experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To
        form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming
        parts of a great whole—we must measure them by their relation to the
        mass of beings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the
        incidents in their<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg
        x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> lives or
        condition which tradition has handed down to us, we must rather
        consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than the
        respective probability of its details.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is unfortunate
        for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know least, and talk
        most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere<a id="noteref_1" name=
        "noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> have,
        perhaps, contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of
        mankind than any other three writers who could be named, and yet the
        history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of
        discussion, which has left us little save the option of choosing
        which theory or theories we will follow. The personality of
        Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which critics will allow us
        to believe without controversy; but upon everything else, even down
        to the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt and
        uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions of
        Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one of the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dramatis
        personae</span></span> in two dramas as unlike in principles as in
        style. He appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their
        tone as those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have
        read Plato <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">or</span></span> Xenophon, we think we know
        something of Socrates; when we have fairly read and examined both, we
        feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been an
        easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny the personal or
        real existence of men and things whose life and condition were too
        much for our belief. This system—which has often comforted the
        religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of Strauss for
        those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable value to the
        historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To question
        the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more excusable act,
        than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact related in
        Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an
        Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same way, is
        more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured old king whom
        the elegant pen of Florian has idealized—<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Numa
        Pompilius.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scepticism has
        attained its culminating point with respect to Homer, and the state
        of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to
        believe any theory, provided we throw overboard<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> all written tradition, concerning the
        author or authors of the Iliad and Odyssey. What few authorities
        exist on the subject, are summarily dismissed, although the arguments
        appear to run in a circle. "This cannot be true, because it is not
        true; and, that is not true, because it cannot be true." Such seems
        to be the style, in which testimony upon testimony, statement upon
        statement, is consigned to denial and oblivion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is, however,
        unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are partly
        forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which truth
        is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of the
        Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken
        of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to
        Herodotus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to this
        document, the city of Cumae in Æolia, was, at an early period, the
        seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of Greece. Among the
        immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes. Although poor, he
        married, and the result of the union was a girl named Critheis. The
        girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the guardianship of
        Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we
        "are indebted for so much happiness." Homer was the first fruit of
        her juvenile frailty, and received the name of Melesigenes, from
        having been born near the river Meles, in Boeotia, whither Critheis
        had been transported in order to save her reputation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"At this time,"
        continues our narrative, "there lived at Smyrna a man named Phemius,
        a teacher of literature and music, who, not being married, engaged
        Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he received as
        the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was her
        performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made
        proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,
        willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever
        man, if he were carefully brought up."</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were married;
        careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had bestowed,
        and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment,
        and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius died,
        leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon followed.
        Melesigenes carried on his adopted father's school with great
        success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of
        Smyrna, but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there,
        especially in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among
        these visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura,
        who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,
        persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his
        travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him
        with a further stipend, urging, that, "While he was yet young, it was
        fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities
        which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses." Melesigenes
        consented, and set out with his patron, "examining all the
        curiosities of the countries they visited, and informing himself of
        everything by interrogating those whom he met." We may also suppose,
        that he<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a name=
        "Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> wrote memoirs of all
        that he deemed worthy of preservation<a id="noteref_2" name=
        "noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> Having
        set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here
        Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse,
        and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the
        medical superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of
        Alcinor. Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes
        rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which
        afterwards formed the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of
        Ithaca assert, that it was here that Melesigenes became blind, but
        the Colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune. He then
        returned to Smyrna, where he applied himself to the study of
        poetry.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But poverty soon
        drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean plain, he arrived
        at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae. Here his
        misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one
        Tychias, an armourer. "And up to my time," continued the author, "the
        inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a
        recitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here
        also a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since
        Melesigenes arrived".<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href=
        "#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But poverty still
        drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being the most
        convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph on
        Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater
        probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.<a id="noteref_5"
        name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Arrived at Cumae,
        he frequented the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">converzationes</span></span><a id="noteref_6"
        name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> of the
        old men, and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by
        this favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him
        a public maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously
        renowned.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg
        xiii]</span><a name="Pgxiii" id="Pgxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he
        proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made
        the speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to
        acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the
        answer to be given to his proposal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The greater part
        of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet's demand, but one man
        observed that "if they were to feed <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Homers,</span></span>
        they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people." "From
        this circumstance," says the writer, "Melesigenes acquired the name
        of Homer, for the Cumans call blind men <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Homers.</span></span>"<a id="noteref_7" name=
        "noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> With a
        love of economy, which shows how similar the world has always been in
        its treatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet
        vented his disappointment in a wish that Cumoea might never produce a
        poet capable of giving it renown and glory.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Phocoea, Homer
        was destined to experience another literary distress. One
        Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept
        Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of
        the verses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected
        sufficient poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some
        would-be-literary publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had
        sucked, and left him. At his departure, Homer is said to have
        observed: "O Thestorides, of the many things hidden from the
        knowledge of man, nothing is more unintelligible than the human
        heart."<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Homer continued
        his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian merchants,
        struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite,
        acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a
        profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at
        once determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to
        be setting sail thither, but he found one ready to Start for
        Erythrae, a town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed
        upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he
        invoked a favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose
        the imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had
        drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Erythrae, Homer
        fortunately met with a person who had known him in Phocoea, by whose
        assistance he at length, after some difficulty, reached the little
        hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure, which we will
        continue in the words of our author. "Having set out from Pithys,
        Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were
        pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus
        (for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up
        quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For or
        some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg xiv]</span><a name="Pgxiv" id="Pgxiv"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reached such a place alone, and what
        could be his design in coming. He then went up to him, and inquired
        who he was, and how he had come to desolate places and untrodden
        spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting to him the
        whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion; and he
        took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade him
        sup.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"The dogs, instead
        of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according to their usual
        habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O Glaucus, my friend,
        prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs their supper at the
        doors of the hut: for so it is better, since, whilst they watch, nor
        thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glaucus was
        pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author. Having finished
        supper, they banqueted<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href=
        "#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> afresh
        on conversation, Homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the
        cities he had visited.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length they
        retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus resolved to go
        to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with Homer. Having
        left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left Homer at home,
        promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus, a place near
        the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole story
        respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to what he
        said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding
        maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the stranger
        to him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Glaucus told Homer
        what had taken place, and bade him follow him, assuring him that good
        fortune would be the result. Conversation soon showed that the
        stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge, and the
        Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the charge of his
        children.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=
        "#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
        satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the island,
        Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of Chios
        he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry. "To
        this day," says Chandler,<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=
        "#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> "the
        most curious remain is that which has been named, without reason, the
        School of Homer. It is on the coast, at some distance from the city,
        northward, and appears to have been an open temple of Cybele, formed
        on the top of a rock. The shape is oval, and in the centre is the
        image of the goddess, the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexv">[pg
        xv]</span><a name="Pgxv" id="Pgxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> head
        and an arm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair
        has a lion carved on each side, and on the back. The area is bounded
        by a low rim, or seat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn
        out of the mountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most
        remote antiquity."</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So successful was
        this school, that Homer realised a considerable fortune. He married,
        and had two daughters, one of whom died single, the other married a
        Chian.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
        passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of the
        poems with the history of the poet, which has already been
        mentioned:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"In his poetical
        compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards Mentor of Ithaca,

        companion of Ulysses,<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=

        return for the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness. He
        also testifies his gratitude to Phemius, who had given him both
        sustenance and instruction."</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His celebrity
        continued to increase, and many persons advised him to visit Greece,
        whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is said, made
        some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the
        Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention,<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        out for Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met with
        him in Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in
        celebrating the Apaturian festival. He recited some verses, which
        gave great satisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon
        festivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich,
        with whose children he was very popular.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the spring he
        sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios, now Ino, where
        he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his death arose from
        vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by
        some fishermen's children.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is, in brief,
        the substance of the earliest life of Homer we possess, and so broad
        are the evidences of its historical worthlessness, that it is
        scarcely necessary to point them out in detail. Let us now consider
        some of the opinions to which a persevering, patient, and learned—but
        by no means consistent—series of investigations has led. In doing so,
        I profess to bring forward statements, not to vouch for their
        reasonableness or probability.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Homer appeared.
        The history of this poet and his works is lost in doubtful obscurity,
        as is the history of many of the first minds who have done honour to
        humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The majestic stream of
        his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the Nile, through many
        lands and nations; and, like the sources of the Nile, its fountains
        will ever remain concealed."</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such are the words
        in which one of the most judicious German critics has eloquently
        described the uncertainty in which the whole of the Homeric question
        is involved. With no less truth and feeling he proceeds:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"It seems here of
        chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes
        possible. If the period of tradition in history is the region of
        twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The creations of
        genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for the most
        part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were in
        possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly
        explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in
        all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet."

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this
        criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of human
        nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic investigation,
        let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer an

        the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of
        fragments by earlier poets?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Well has Landor
        remarked: "Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some deny that
        there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the contents of
        a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are perpetually
        labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our devotion to
        superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know what is
        good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our
        admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do."

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, greatly as we
        admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry
        on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered, without
        seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute
        analysis—our editorial office compels us to give some attention to
        the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric question is beset,
        and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to prefer his judgment
        to his imagination, and to condescend to dry details.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before, however,
        entering into particulars respecting the question of this unity of
        the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must express my
        sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"We cannot but
        think the universal admiration of its unity by the better, the poetic
        age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its original
        composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that its
        primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to
        assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not
        the best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive
        conception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may
        be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the
        opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general
        beauty of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley
        Cooper.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexvii">[pg

        which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the
        authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and cautious Thucydides
        quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,<a id="noteref_20" name=

        authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics.

        be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of
        Homer ever arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in
        favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what are the
        discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the end of the
        seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on the subject, and
        we find Bentley remarking that "Homer wrote a sequel of songs and
        rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and good cheer,
        at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs were not
        collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about
        Peisistratus' time, about five hundred years after."<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two French
        writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism on the
        subject; but it is in the "Scienza Nuova" of Battista Vico, that we
        first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf
        with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian
        theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold
        hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote<a id=
        "noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Half a century
        ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf, turning to
        account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagexviii">[pg xviii]</span><a name="Pgxviii" id=
        "Pgxviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> recently published, first
        opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the Homeric
        text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by no means
        the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously
        announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent
        portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into
        any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of
        Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards
        that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either
        poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to
        which their composition is referred; and that without writing,
        neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been
        originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him,
        transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and
        convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long
        manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in
        Wolf's case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey.
        By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of
        the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally
        put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended
        the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain
        that they were written poems from the beginning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"To me it appears,
        that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to Peisistratus and
        his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are nowise
        admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of
        the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to controvert it,
        we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems, in
        the ninth century before the Christian aera. Few things, in my
        opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight, opposed as he
        is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than Wolf himself.
        The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh century before
        the Christian aera, are exceedingly trifling. We have no remaining
        inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early
        inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even
        assure ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, Kallinus,
        Tyrtaeus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets,
        committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the practice
        of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which
        authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is
        in the famous ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at
        the Panathenaea: but for what length of time previously manuscripts
        had existed, we are unable to say.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Those who
        maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the beginning,
        rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the existing
        habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit generally that
        the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and heard,—but upon
        the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to
        ensure the preservation of the poems—the unassisted memory of
        reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. But here we only
        escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the
        existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary
        memory,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexix">[pg xix]</span><a name=
        "Pgxix" id="Pgxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <a id="noteref_25"

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> is far
        less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age essentially
        non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable instruments and
        materials for the process are not obvious. Moreover, there is a
        strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no
        necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript; for if
        such had been the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification
        for the profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the
        example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard
        of Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well
        as the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer
        himself. The author of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have
        described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art,
        if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only
        maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest."</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The loss of the
        digamma, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">crux</span></span> of critics, that quicksand
        upon which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove
        beyond a doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had
        undergone a considerable change. Now it is certainly difficult to
        suppose that the Homeric poems could have suffered by this change,
        had written copies been preserved. If Chaucer's poetry, for instance,
        had not been written, it could only have come down to us in a
        softened form, more like the effeminate version of Dryden, than the
        rough, quaint, noble original.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"At what period,"
        continues Grote, "these poems, or indeed any other Greek poems, first
        began to be written, must be matter of conjecture, though there is
        ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solon. If, in the
        absence of evidence, we may venture upon<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexx">[pg xx]</span><a name="Pgxx" id="Pgxx" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> naming any more determinate period, the
        question a once suggests itself, What were the purposes which, in
        that state of society, a manuscript at its first commencement must
        have been intended to answer? For whom was a written Iliad necessary?
        Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the
        memory, but also interwoven with the feelings, and conceived in
        conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice, pauses,
        and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery,
        and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce. Not for the
        general public—they were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic
        delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded
        festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would be
        suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of
        readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had
        experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the
        written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of
        the impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the
        statement may seem in an age like the present, there is in all early
        societies, and there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading
        class existed. If we could discover at what time such a class first
        began to be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time
        when the old epic poems were first committed to writing. Now the
        period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as
        having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading
        class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh century before the
        Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630), the age of Terpander,
        Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, &amp;c. I ground this
        supposition on the change then operated in the character and
        tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac and the iambic
        measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter,
        and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical
        past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a change was
        important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of
        publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the
        nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at
        the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new
        poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be
        considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from
        their own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric
        rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and
        eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer. There seems,
        therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this
        newly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of
        the Homeric poems and other old epics,—the Thebais and the Cypria, as
        well as the Iliad and the Odyssey,—began to be compiled towards the
        middle of the seventh century (B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to
        Grecian commerce, which took place about the same period, would
        furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to
        write upon. A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly
        increase, and the number of manuscripts along with it; so that before
        the time of Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and
        manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have attained
        a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxi">[pg xxi]</span><a name="Pgxxi"

        Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the
        credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following
        observations—</p>

        "font-size: 90%">"There are several incidental circumstances which,
        in our opinion, throw some suspicion over the whole history of the
        Peisistratid compilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad
        was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the
        directions of the Athenian ruler. If the great poets, who flourished
        at the bright period of Grecian song, of which, alas! we have
        inherited little more than the fame, and the faint echo, if
        Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonides were employed in the noble task
        of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much must have been done to
        arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is almost incredible, that
        stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should not remain. Whatever
        occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies which no doubt arise
        out of our own ignorance of the language of the Homeric age, however
        the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys, to
        whom the name of Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and
        distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age, however
        Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the Homeric language to its
        primitive form; however, finally, the Attic dialect may not have
        assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristics—still
        it is difficult to suppose that the language, particularly in the
        joinings and transitions, and connecting parts, should not more
        clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern
        forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such a period
        to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an imperfect poem
        in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott has done in his
        continuation of Sir Tristram.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">"If, however, not even such faint and indistinct
          traces of Athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of
          the poems, the total absence of Athenian national feeling is
          perhaps no less worthy of observation. In later, and it may fairly
          be suspected in earlier times, the Athenians were more than
          ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors. But, amid all
          the traditions of the glories of early Greece embodied in the
          Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant
          part. Even the few passages which relate to their ancestors, Mr.
          Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible, indeed, that
          in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic fact,
          that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against the
          rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadae, the chieftain
          of Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have
          been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign; the
          preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus
          have forced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their
          taste. The songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no
          doubt, of far inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first
          sight, a Theseid would have been much more likely to have emanated
          from an Athenian synod of compilers of</span><span class=

          they are sometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles,
          with all its direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest
          of the poetic cycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still
          surprising, that throughout the whole poem the</span> <span class=

          an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a race, who have
          at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring
          neighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self denial to the
          almost total exclusion of their own ancestors—or, at least, to the
          questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably
          skilled in the military tactics of his age."</span><a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To return to the
        Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that Wolf's objections
        to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have never been
        wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they have failed to
        enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the difficulties
        with which the whole subject is beset, are rather augmented than
        otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann's<a id=
        "noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>
        modification of his theory any better. He divides the first
        twenty-two books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and
        treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one
        regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of
        Peisistratus. This, as Grote observes, "explains the gaps and
        contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else."
        Moreover, we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the
        so-called sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following
        leading men in the first battle after the secession of Achilles:
        Elphenor, chief of the Euboeans; Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians;
        Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of the Halizonians; Pirous and
        Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes again make their
        appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure, that "it seems
        strange that any number of independent poets should have so
        harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel."
        The discrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is represented as dead in
        the fifth book, weeps at his son's funeral in the thirteenth, can
        only be regarded as the result of an interpolation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Grote, although
        not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the subject, has
        done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian theory, and
        of Lachmann's modifications with the character of Peisistratus. But
        he has also shown, and we think with equal success, that the two
        questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems, or,
        supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by Peisistratus,
        and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In short, "a man
        may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of pre-existing
        songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the period of
        its first compilation." The friends or literary <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">employes</span></span>
        of Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient,
        and the silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the
        Peisistratic "recension," goes far<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexxiii">[pg xxiii]</span><a name="Pgxxiii" id="Pgxxiii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> to prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts
        they examined, this was either wanting, or thought unworthy of
        attention.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Moreover," he
        continues, "the whole tenor of the poems themselves confirms what is
        here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad or Odyssey,
        which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age of
        Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our view the alterations brought
        about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined money, the
        habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican
        governments, the close military array, the improved construction of
        ships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of
        religious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion,
        &amp;c., familiar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus,
        and the other literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have
        failed to notice, even without design, had they then, for the first
        time, undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent
        epics into one large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric
        poems, both in substance and in language, belongs to an age two or
        three centuries earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the
        interpolations (or those passages which, on the best grounds, are
        pronounced to be such) betray no trace of the sixth century before
        Christ, and may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in
        some cases even by Arktinus and Hesiod—as genuine Homeric
        matter<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=
        "#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> As far
        as the evidences on the case, as well internal as external, enable us
        to judge, we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey
        were recited substantially as they now stand (always allowing for
        paitial divergences of text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our
        first trustworthy mark of Grecian time; and this ancient date, let it
        be added, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is also the
        most important attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in
        reference to Grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into
        the anti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the
        subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive
        contrasts between their former and their later condition."<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole, I am
        inclined to believe, that the labours of Peisistratus were wholly of
        an editorial character, although, I must confess, that I can lay down
        nothing respecting the extent of his labours. At the same time, so
        far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of
        these poems, in their present form, was the work of Peisistratus, I
        am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that
        Athenian<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href=
        "#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> would
        lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems,
        rather than to patch and re-construct them according to a fanciful
        hypothesis. I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether
        the poems were written or not, or whether the art of writing was
        known in the time of their reputed author. Suffice it to say, that
        the more we read, the less satisfied we are upon either
        subject.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxiv">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot, however,
        help thinking, that the story which attributes the preservation of
        these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version of the same
        story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical probability must
        be measured by that of many others relating to the Spartan
        Confucius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I will conclude
        this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt, made by an
        ingenious friend, to unite them into something like consistency. It
        is as follows:—</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">"No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like
        the common sailors of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to
        'discourse in excellent music' among them. Many of these, like those
        of the negroes in the United States, were extemporaneous, and
        allusive to events passing around them. But what was passing around
        them? The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely
        to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had
        done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was deemed
        a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those
        ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war
        with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed
        a species of recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next
        followed, as it aided the memory considerably.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">"It was at this period, about four hundred years
          after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes,
          or Moeonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these
          ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a
          poem on the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he
          published these lays, connecting them by a tale of his own. This
          poem now exists, under the title of the 'Odyssea.' The author,
          however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact,
          was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of
          Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore
          called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather
          a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging
          arrangement of other people's ideas; for, as Grote has finely
          observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, 'a great poet might
          have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive
          whole; but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do
          so.'</span></p>

          <span style="font-size: 90%">grew under his hand. Unity of design,
          however, caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme
          as his former work: and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards
          were joined together, like those relating to the Cid, into a
          chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that the poem
          was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but, first,
          the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and
          corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets,
          assemblies, and agoras. However, Solon first, and

          Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored the works
          of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great
          measure."</span><a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus given
        some general notion of the strange theories which have developed
        themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I must still
        express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the
        Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations
        disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may
        here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the
        negligence of the copyist, would be an absurd and captious
        assumption, but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal, if
        we would either understand or enjoy these poems. In maintaining the
        authenticity and personality of their one author, be he Homer or
        Melesigenes, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">quocunque nomine vocari eum jus fasque
        sit,</span></span> I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of
        historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign
        these great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful
        internal evidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most
        immediate impulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the
        contrary.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The minutiae of
        verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise. Indeed,
        considering the character of some of my own books, such an attempt
        would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its importance
        in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on its
        aesthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the emendations
        made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had they been
        suggested to the author by his Maecenas or Africanus, he would
        probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in laying
        down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often least
        competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not poets
        by profession, but may be so <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">per accidens.</span></span> I do not at this
        moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially
        improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from
        Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand
        minute points, without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and
        jejune.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is not on
        words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will exercise their
        elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an heroic or
        dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected
        his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the pruning
        knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their wish to
        make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book after
        book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a
        collection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed
        the works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a
        vile counterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of
        Knight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of
        the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of
        Homer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of
        his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvi">[pg xxvi]</span><a name=
        "Pgxxvi" id="Pgxxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> theory. One cuts a
        supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting
        something else.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor is this morbid
        species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a literary
        novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill, seems to
        revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies attributed to
        Seneca are by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">four</span></span> different authors.<a id=
        "noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> Now, I
        will venture to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only
        in their borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with which writers like
        Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves—in
        their freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an
        ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few
        writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the
        same gentleman, be he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a
        great many more equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin
        astonished the world with the startling announcement that the Æneid
        of Virgil, and the satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now,
        without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry
        and learning—nay, the refined acuteness—which scholars, like Wolf,
        have bestowed upon this subject, I must express my fears, that many
        of our modern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise
        and entertainment, rather than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can
        I help thinking, that the literary history of more recent times will
        account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the
        Iliad and Odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first
        creation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have already
        expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus were of a purely
        editorial character; and there seems no more reason why corrupt and
        imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in his day, than
        that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should have given so
        much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after all, the
        main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand too great
        a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully
        appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which
        has sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too
        much violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul
        yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To
        believe the author of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the
        powers of human invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the
        expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the
        ocean in the contemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so
        to speak, in the very name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the
        Iliad may be a mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a
        better.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While, however, I
        look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature herself for its
        mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in believing in Homer as
        the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers round the bed of the
        poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination
        which a host of imitators could not exhaust,—still I am far from
        wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich
        fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from
        whence<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxvii">[pg
        xxvii]</span><a name="Pgxxvii" id="Pgxxvii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> he might derive both subject and embellishment.
        But it is one thing to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">use</span></span> existing romances in the
        embellishment of a poem, another to patch up the poem itself from
        such materials. What consistency of style and execution can be hoped
        for from such an attempt? or, rather, what bad taste and tedium will
        not be the infallible result?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A blending of
        popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other bards, are
        features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In fact, the
        most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions—nay,
        even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support
        and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be some grand
        pervading principle—some invisible, yet most distinctly stamped
        archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never come
        to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most
        pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and
        great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in
        more substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power
        to create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and
        embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a
        parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their
        wild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which
        will require little acuteness to detect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sensible as I am
        of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware as I must be of
        the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief, it still seems
        to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher
        criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature intended
        to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which the
        greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were
        faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our
        ignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary
        lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried
        touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence
        upon the condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness
        attached to the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid
        us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into
        a pleasing apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an
        homeopathic dynameter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Long and habitual
        reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts even to his
        incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and with a
        heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply wrapped
        in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots which mere
        analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must transform
        ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination must fight
        over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the same sense
        of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but attain this
        degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for
        the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of Homer are not
        only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer that ever
        touched the hearts of men by the power of song.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And it was this
        supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their powerful

        nation. No poet has ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence
        over his countrymen. Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the
        character of other nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of
        the Greeks. This is a feature in their character which was not wholly
        erased even in the period of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and
        sages appeared in Greece, the work of the poet had already been
        accomplished; and they paid homage to his superior genius. He held up
        before his nation the mirror, in which they were to behold the world
        of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them
        reflected with purity and truth. His poems are founded on the first
        feeling of human nature; on the love of children, wife, and country;
        on that passion which outweighs all others, the love of glory. His
        songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the
        feelings of man; and therefore they enter, and will continue to
        enter, every breast which cherishes the same sympathies. If it is
        granted to his immortal spirit, from another heaven than any of which
        he dreamed on earth, to look down on his race, to see the nations
        from the fields of Asia to the forests of Hercynia, performing
        pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow; if
        it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand, of
        elevated, of glorious productions, which had been called into being

          uncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the
          Ptolemies, know or care about that department of criticism employed
          in determining the genuineness of ancient writings. As to this
          little poem being a youthful prolusion of Homer, it seems
          sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain
          and palpable parody, not only of the general spirit, but of the
          numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and even, if no such
          intention to parody were discernible in it, the objection would
          still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the
          primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse that
          order in the development of national taste, which the history of
          every other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost
          ascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of
          society much more refined and permanent than that described in the
          Iliad, that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and
          the gods as is contained in this poem; and the fact of there having
          existed three other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we
          can see, with as much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to
          believe that none of them were of the Homeric age. Knight infers
          from the usage of the word deltos, "writing tablet," instead of
          diphthera, "skin," which, according to Herod. 5, 58, was the
          material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that purpose, that this
          poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity; and generally that
          the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a strong argument
          against so ancient a date for its composition."</span></p>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus given
        a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope's design, I will now
        proceed to make a few remarks on his translation, and on my own
        purpose in the present edition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pope was not a
        Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his earliest
        acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby. It is
        not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a
        disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to
        dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence
        his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase
        than a translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional
        anecdotes, which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose
        classical attainments were sounder than his own, during the
        undertaking; but it is probable that these examinations were the
        result rather of the contradictory versions already existing, than of
        a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original. And in those
        days, what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at
        present. If something like the general sense could be decorated with
        the easy gracefulness of a practised poet; if the charms of metrical
        cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair
        interpretation of the poet's meaning, his <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">words</span></span>
        were less jealously sought for, and those who could read so good a
        poem as Pope's Iliad had fair reason to be satisfied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
        absurd, therefore, to test Pope's translation by our own advancing
        knowledge of the original text. We must be content to<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagexxx">[pg xxx]</span><a name="Pgxxx" id="Pgxxx"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> look at it as a most delightful work in
        itself,—a work which is as much a part of English literature as Homer
        himself is of Greek. We must not be torn from our kindly associations
        with the old Iliad, that once was our most cherished companion, or
        our most looked-for prize, merely because Buttmann, Loewe, and
        Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to amphikupellon being
        an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from us to defend the
        faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman's fine, bold,
        rough old English;—far be it from, us to hold up his translation as
        what a translation of Homer <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">might</span></span> be. But we can still dismiss
        Pope's Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the consciousness that
        they must have read a very great number of books before they have
        read its fellow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the Notes
        accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up without
        pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general reader.
        Having some little time since translated all the works of Homer for
        another publisher, I might have brought a large amount of accumulated
        matter, sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the text. But
        Pope's version was no field for such a display; and my purpose was to
        touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions, to notice
        occasionally <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">some</span></span> departures from the original,
        and to give a few parallel passages from our English Homer, Milton.
        In the latter task I cannot pretend to novelty, but I trust that my
        other annotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views,
        will be found to convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the
        necessary limits of these volumes could be expected to admit. To
        write a commentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I have made
        Pope's translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a
        mass of miscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes
        satisfactorily accomplished.</p>

        HOMER</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Homer is
        universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer
        whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested with
        him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular
        excellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a
        wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who
        most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is
        the invention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great
        geniuses: the utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry,
        which masters everything besides, can never attain to this. It
        furnishes art with all her materials, and without it judgment itself
        can at best but "steal wisely:" for art is only like a prudent
        steward that lives on managing the riches of nature. Whatever praises
        may be given to works of judgment, there is not even a single beauty
        in them to which the invention must not contribute: as in the most
        regular gardens, art can only reduce beauties of nature to more
        regularity, and such a figure, which the common eye may better take
        in, and is, therefore, more entertained with. And, perhaps, the
        reason why common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and
        methodical genius to a great and fruitful one, is, because they find
        it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through a
        uniform and bounded walk of art, than to comprehend the vast and
        various extent of nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our author's work
        is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the beauties so
        distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the number of
        them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery, which
        contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of which
        those who followed him have but selected some particular plants, each
        according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things are
        too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if others
        are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because they
        are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is to the
        strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that
        unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no
        man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads
        him. What he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every
        thing moves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be
        called, or a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was
        said<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxii">[pg xxxii]</span><a name=
        "Pgxxxii" id="Pgxxxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or done as from a
        third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of
        the poet's imagination, and turns in one place to a hearer, in
        another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles that of
        the army he describes,</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"They pour along
        like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it." It is, however,
        remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous, is not
        discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest
        splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and others, and
        becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exact
        disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers, may
        have been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this "vivida vis
        animi," in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect or
        neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even
        while we disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with
        absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see
        nothing but its own splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but
        discerned as through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than
        fierce, but everywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it
        bursts out in sudden, short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it
        glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of
        art: in Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental
        fire from heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns everywhere
        clearly and everywhere irresistibly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I shall here
        endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner
        superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts
        of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which
        distinguishes him from all other authors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This strong and
        ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the violence of
        its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed not enough
        to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compass of
        nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward passions
        and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all the
        outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but wanting
        yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and boundless
        walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in the
        invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls "the soul of poetry,"
        was first breathed into it by Homer, I shall begin with considering
        him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak of it both
        as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for fiction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fable may be
        divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the marvellous. The
        probable fable is the recital of such actions as, though they did not
        happen, yet might, in the common course of nature; or of such as,
        though they did, became fables by the additional episodes and manner
        of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of an epic poem, "The
        return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in Italy," or the
        like. That of the Iliad is the "anger of Achilles," the most short
        and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet this he has
        supplied with a vaster variety of incidents<span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pagexxxiii">[pg xxxiii]</span><a name="Pgxxxiii" id="Pgxxxiii"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and events, and crowded with a greater
        number of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds,
        than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of the
        utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is hurried on with the
        most vehement spirit, and its whole duration employs not so much as
        fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a genius, aided himself by
        taking in a more extensive subject, as well as a greater length of
        time, and contracting the design of both Homer's poems into one,
        which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The other epic poets
        have used the same practice, but generally carried it so far as to
        superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of action,
        and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor is it
        only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his
        invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of
        story. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw
        up their forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for
        Patroclus, Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than
        omit them) destroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus.
        If Ulysses visit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius
        are sent after him. If he be detained from his return by the
        allurements of Calypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida.
        If Achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through
        half the poem, Rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like
        account. If he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and
        Tasso make the same present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed
        this close imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way,
        supplied the want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon,
        and the taking of Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for
        word from Pisander, as the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from
        those of Medea and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the
        same manner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To proceed to the
        allegorical fable—If we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges,
        those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which Homer is
        generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories, what a new
        and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us! How
        fertile will that imagination appear, which as able to clothe all the
        properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues
        and vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions
        agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field
        in which no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer, and whatever
        commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means
        for their invention in having enlarged his circle, but for their
        judgment in having contracted it. For when the mode of learning
        changed in the following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer
        manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay
        it aside, as it was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was no
        unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that
        demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of
        furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The marvellous
        fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially the machines
        of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the deities
        (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of<span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pagexxxiv">[pg xxxiv]</span><a name="Pgxxxiv" id="Pgxxxiv" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Greece, he seems the first who brought them
        into a system of machinery for poetry, and such a one as makes its
        greatest importance and dignity: for we find those authors who have
        been offended at the literal notion of the gods, constantly laying
        their accusation against Homer as the chief support of it. But
        whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a
        philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic,
        that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have
        been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has
        set: every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after
        all the various changes of times and religions, his gods continue to
        this day the gods of poetry.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We come now to the
        characters of his persons; and here we shall find no author has ever
        drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a variety, or given us
        such lively and affecting impressions of them. Every one has
        something so singularly his own, that no painter could have
        distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by their
        manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has
        observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single
        quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several
        characters of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable;
        that of Diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to
        command; that of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active
        and vigilant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of
        empire and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness and
        tenderness for his people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct
        soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this
        judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal
        quality which constitutes the main of each character, but even in the
        under parts of it, to which he takes care to give a tincture of that
        principal one. For example: the main characters of Ulysses and Nestor
        consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this, that the wisdom of
        one is artificial and various, of the other natural, open, and
        regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and this
        quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of
        his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the
        other upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of
        these kinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in
        this open manner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and
        undistinguished; and, where they are marked most evidently affect us
        not in proportion to those of Homer. His characters of valour are
        much alike; even that of Turnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is,
        in a superior degree; and we see nothing that differences the courage
        of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest, In like
        manner it may be remarked of Statius's heroes, that an air of
        impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savage courage
        appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, &amp;c. They have a
        parity of character, which makes them seem brothers of one family. I
        believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection, if he
        will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers, he will be
        convinced how infinitely superior, in this point, the invention of
        Homer was to that of all others.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexxxv">[pg xxxv]</span><a name="xxxv" id="xxxv" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The speeches are
        to be considered as they flow from the characters; being perfect or
        defective as they agree or disagree with the manners, of those who
        utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the Iliad, so
        there is of speeches, than in any other poem. "Everything in it has
        manner" (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is acted or
        spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how small a
        number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the dramatic
        part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches often
        consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be equally
        just in any person's mouth upon the same occasion. As many of his
        persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape
        being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think
        of the author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged
        in Homer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that
        interests us less in the action described. Homer makes us hearers,
        and Virgil leaves us readers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, in the next
        place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same presiding faculty
        is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts. Longinus has
        given his opinion, that it was in this part Homer principally
        excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and
        excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they have so
        remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his
        Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this
        sort. And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that
        if Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has
        not so many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author
        seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired
        by the Iliad.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we observe his
        descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the invention still
        predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of
        images of every sort, where we see each circumstance of art, and
        individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and fecundity
        of his imagination to which all things, in their various views
        presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions taken
        off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full
        prospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side
        views, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising
        as the descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half
        the Iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that
        no one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths,
        that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a
        profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in
        greatness, horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near
        that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every
        one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is
        evident of Virgil especially, that he has scarce any comparisons
        which are not drawn from his master.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we descend from
        hence to the expression, we see the bright imagination of Homer
        shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We acknowledge him the
        father of poetical diction; the first who taught that "language of
        the gods" to men. His expression is like<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexxxvi">[pg xxxvi]</span><a name="Pgxxxvi" id="Pgxxxvi" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the colouring of some great masters, which
        discovers itself to be laid on boldly, and executed with rapidity. It
        is, indeed, the strongest and most glowing imaginable, and touched
        with the greatest spirit. Aristotle had reason to say, he was the
        only poet who had found out "living words;" there are in him more
        daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever. An
        arrow is "impatient" to be on the wing, a weapon "thirsts" to drink
        the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet his expression is never too
        big for the sense, but justly great in proportion to it. It is the
        sentiment that swells and fills out the diction, which rises with it,
        and forms itself about it, for in the same degree that a thought is
        warmer, an expression will be brighter, as that is more strong, this
        will become more perspicuous; like glass in the furnace, which grows
        to a greater magnitude, and refines to a greater clearness, only as
        the breath within is more powerful, and the heat more intense.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To throw his
        language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected the compound
        epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry,
        not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted and filled
        the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise conduced in
        some measure to thicken the images. On this last consideration I
        cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention,
        since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of supernumerary
        pictures of the persons or things to which they were joined. We see
        the motion of Hector's plumes in the epithet Korythaiolos, the
        landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Einosiphyllos, and so of
        others, which particular images could not have been insisted upon so
        long as to express them in a description (though but of a single
        line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal action
        or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these epithets is
        a short description.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, if we
        consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a share of
        praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not satisfied
        with his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece,
        but searched through its different dialects with this particular
        view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they
        had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and accordingly
        employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or
        strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has a peculiar
        sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its custom of
        resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make the words
        open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency. With this
        he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the feebler
        Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent, and
        completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of
        poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his sense,
        were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture,
        and even to give a further representation of his notions, in the
        correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all
        these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not
        only the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so
        great a truth, that whoever will but<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexxxvii">[pg xxxvii]</span><a name="Pgxxxvii" id="Pgxxxvii"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> consult the tune of his verses, even
        without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we
        daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more
        sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language
        of poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be
        copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to
        ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has
        some advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the
        turn and cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no
        other language. Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost
        diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever
        graces it was capable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring
        the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the
        Grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as
        the Roman, the only reason is, that fewer critics have understood one
        language than the other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out
        many of our author's beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the
        Composition of Words. It suffices at present to observe of his
        numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to make one imagine
        Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the Muses
        dictated, and, at the same time, with so much force and inspiriting
        vigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet.
        They roll along as a plentiful river, always in motion, and always
        full; while we are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and
        yet the most smooth imaginable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus on whatever
        side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us is his
        invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of his
        work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more
        extensive and copious than any other, his manners more lively and
        strongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his
        sentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more
        full and animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his
        numbers more rapid and various. I hope, in what has been said of
        Virgil, with regard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated
        from his character. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the
        common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of
        particular passages in them, and forming a judgment from thence of
        their merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledge of
        the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is
        in that we are to consider him, and in proportion to his degree in
        that we are to admire him. No author or man ever excelled all the
        world in more than one faculty; and as Homer has done this in
        invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that we are to think that
        Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a more eminent
        degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer possessed a
        larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of both than
        perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in comparison
        with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the better
        artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work. Homer
        hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil leads
        us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous
        profusion;<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxviii">[pg
        xxxviii]</span><a name="Pgxxxviii" id="Pgxxxviii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence;
        Homer, like the Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow;
        Virgil, like a river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream.
        When we behold their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the
        heroes they celebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles,
        bears all before him, and shines more and more as the tumult
        increases; Virgil, calmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed in
        the midst of the action; disposes all about him, and conquers with
        tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like
        his own Jupiter in his terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the
        lightnings, and firing the heavens: Virgil, like the same power in
        his benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying plans for empires,
        and regularly ordering his whole creation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But after all, it
        is with great parts, as with great virtues, they naturally border on
        some imperfection; and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where
        the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As prudence may sometimes sink
        to suspicion, so may a great judgment decline to coldness; and as
        magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance, so may a great
        invention to redundancy or wildness. If we look upon Homer in this
        view, we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed
        from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among these we may
        reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which so much criticism
        has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of probability. Perhaps
        it may be with great and superior souls, as with gigantic bodies,
        which, exerting themselves with unusual strength, exceed what is
        commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become miracles in
        the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit something
        near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable
        performances. Thus Homer has his "speaking horses;" and Virgil his
        "myrtles distilling blood;" where the latter has not so much as
        contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the
        probability.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is owing to the
        same vast invention, that his similes have been thought too exuberant
        and full of circumstances. The force of this faculty is seen in
        nothing more, than in its inability to confine itself to that single
        circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded: it runs out into
        embellishments of additional images, which, however, are so managed
        as not to overpower the main one. His similes are like pictures,
        where the principal figure has not only its proportion given
        agreeable to the original, but is also set off with occasional
        ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his manner of
        heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when his
        fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent
        images. The reader will easily extend this observation to more
        objections of the same kind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If there are
        others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of
        genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will be found
        upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he
        lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods; and the
        vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must
        here<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxxix">[pg xxxix]</span><a name=
        "xxxix" id="xxxix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> speak a word of the
        latter, as it is a point generally carried into extremes, both by the
        censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a strange partiality to
        antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,<a id="noteref_38" name=
        "noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> "that
        those times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are
        more contrary to ours." Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as
        to magnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and
        cruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned
        through the world: when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre;
        when the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and
        daughters made slaves and concubines? On the other side, I would not
        be so delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the
        servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the
        heroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that
        simplicity, in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in
        beholding monarchs without their guards; princes tending their
        flocks, and princesses drawing water from the springs. When we read
        Homer, we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient
        author in the heathen world; and those who consider him in this
        light, will double their pleasure in the perusal of him. Let them
        think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are
        now no more; that they are stepping almost three thousand years back
        into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining themselves with a clear
        and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found, the only
        true mirror of that ancient world. By this means alone their greatest
        obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their dislike, will
        become a satisfaction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This consideration
        may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets
        to his gods and heroes; such as the "far-darting Phoebus," the
        "blue-eyed Pallas," the "swift-footed Achilles," &amp;c., which some
        have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those of the
        gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to
        them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and
        solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of
        attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on
        all occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the
        epithets of great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in
        the nature of surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks having
        no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other
        distinction of each person; either naming his parents expressly, or
        his place of birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of
        Philip, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &amp;c.
        Homer, therefore, complying with the custom of his country, used such
        distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we
        have something parallel to these in modern times, such as the names
        of Harold Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the
        Black Prince, &amp;c. If yet this be thought to account better for
        the propriety than for the repetition, I shall add a further
        conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the world into its different ages, has
        placed a fourth age, between the brazen and the iron one, of "heroes
        distinct from other<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexl">[pg
        xl]</span><a name="Pgxl" id="Pgxl" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> men; a
        divine race who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and
        live by the care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed." Now among
        the divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in
        common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an
        epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their
        families, actions or qualities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What other cavils
        have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly deserve a reply,
        but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the
        work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt
        Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should think to raise the
        superstructure by undermining the foundation: one would imagine, by
        the whole course of their parallels, that these critics never so much
        as heard of Homer's having written first; a consideration which
        whoever compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye.
        Some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in
        the other; as when they prefer the fable and moral of the Æneis to
        those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which might set the Odyssey
        above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser man, and the action of
        the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other; or
        else they blame him for not doing what he never designed; as because
        Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as Æneas, when the very
        moral of his poem required a contrary character: it is thus that
        Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others select
        those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as some
        that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of
        Scaliger in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low
        and mean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and
        refinement, oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original,
        and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations: this
        is the conduct of Perrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are
        others, who, pretending to a fairer proceeding, distinguish between
        the personal merit of Homer, and that of his work; but when they come
        to assign the causes of the great reputation of the Iliad, they found
        it upon the ignorance of his times, and the prejudice of those that
        followed: and in pursuance of this principle, they make those
        accidents (such as the contention of the cities, &amp;c.) to be the
        causes of his fame, which were in reality the consequences of his
        merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or any great author
        whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions
        to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Mott; who yet
        confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived, he
        must have been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he may be
        said in his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed
        him.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all these
        objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honour of
        the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed the
        characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his followers,
        he still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may commit
        fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of
        critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and
        most<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexli">[pg xli]</span><a name=
        "Pgxli" id="Pgxli" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> universal applauses
        which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment.
        Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry, but excels all the
        inventors of other arts, in this, that he has swallowed up the honour
        of those who succeeded him. What he has done admitted no increase, it
        only left room for contraction or regulation. He showed all the
        stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in some of his
        flights, it was but because he attempted everything. A work of this
        kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most vigorous
        seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the finest
        fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit join
        to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have only
        said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of
        nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular
        appearance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having now spoken
        of the beauties and defects of the original, it remains to treat of
        the translation, with the same view to the chief characteristic. As
        far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem, such as the fable,
        manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice it but by wilful
        omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in every particular
        image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too much softens
        those, takes off from this chief character. It is the first grand
        duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed; and
        for the rest, the diction and versification only are his proper
        province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to take
        as he finds them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It should then be
        considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language
        for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no literal
        translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior
        language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done)
        that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which
        is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating
        into the modern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a
        darkness, there is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better
        preserves than a version almost literal. I know no liberties one
        ought to take, but those which are necessary to transfusing the
        spirit of the original, and supporting the poetical style of the
        translation: and I will venture to say, there have not been more men
        misled in former times by a servile, dull adherence to the letter,
        than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical, insolent hope of
        raising and improving their author. It is not to be doubted, that the
        fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as
        it is most likely to expire in his managing: however, it is his
        safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the
        whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is,
        in any particular place. It is a great secret in writing, to know
        when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative; and it is what
        Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps.
        Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours as high as we
        can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be deterred
        from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere
        English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer<span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pagexlii">[pg xlii]</span><a name="Pgxlii" id="Pgxlii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> seems to have been more commonly mistaken than
        the just pitch of his style: some of his translators having swelled
        into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime; others sunk into
        flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity. Methinks I see
        these different followers of Homer, some sweating and straining after
        him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain signs of false mettle),
        others slowly and servilely creeping in his train, while the poet
        himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal
        majesty before them. However, of the two extremes one could sooner
        pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be envied for such
        commendations, as he may gain by that character of style, which his
        friends must agree together to call simplicity, and the rest of the
        world will call dulness. There is a graceful and dignified
        simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as much
        from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven: it
        is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all.
        Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This pure and
        noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the Scripture
        and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the inspired
        writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words but what
        were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that part of
        the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his style
        must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than
        that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what has
        been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks,
        induce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those
        general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a
        veneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament;
        as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the
        Divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a further
        preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care should be
        taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and
        proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have
        something venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned
        gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which
        would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a
        more ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps the
        mixture of some Graecisms and old words after the manner of Milton,
        if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill effect in
        a version of this particular work, which most of any other seems to
        require a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of modern
        terms of war and government, such as "platoon, campaign, junto," or
        the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be
        allowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to
        treat the subjects in any living language.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two
        peculiarities in Homer's diction, which are a sort of marks or moles
        by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight; those who
        are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects, and those
        who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I speak of his
        compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the<span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagexliii">[pg xliii]</span><a name="Pgxliii" id=
        "Pgxliii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> former cannot be done literally
        into English without destroying the purity of our language. I believe
        such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an English
        compound, without violence to the ear or to the received rules of
        composition, as well as those which have received a sanction from the
        authority of our best poets, and are become familiar through their
        use of them; such as "the cloud-compelling Jove," &amp;c. As for the
        rest, whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a
        single word as in a compounded one, the course to be taken is
        obvious.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some that cannot
        be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one or two words,
        may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epithet
        einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous
        translated literally "leaf-shaking," but affords a majestic idea in
        the periphrasis: "the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods." Others
        that admit of different significations, may receive an advantage from
        a judicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are
        introduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, hekaebolos or
        "far-shooting," is capable of two explications; one literal, in
        respect of the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other
        allegorical, with regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such
        places where Apollo is represented as a god in person, I would use
        the former interpretation; and where the effects of the sun are
        described, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will
        be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets
        which we find in Homer, and which, though it might be accommodated
        (as has been already shown) to the ear of those times, is by no means
        so to ours: but one may wait for opportunities of placing them, where
        they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are
        employed; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once show
        his fancy and his judgment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As for Homer's
        repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of whole narrations
        and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or hemistitch. I
        hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these, as neither
        to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor to offend
        the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not ungraceful in
        those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of
        insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods to men, or
        from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the
        ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of
        prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the best rule
        is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the
        repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close,
        one may vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a
        professed translator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious,
        the author is to answer for it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It only remains to
        speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said) is perpetually
        applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every new subject.
        This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry, and
        attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it in the
        Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may
        sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and
        fully<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexliv">[pg xliv]</span><a name=
        "Pgxliv" id="Pgxliv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> possessed of his
        image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed this, in
        whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all
        others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who
        have, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon the whole, I
        must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to Homer. I
        attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without
        much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire
        translation in verse has yet done. We have only those of Chapman,
        Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an
        immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce
        any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent
        interpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the
        thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty
        verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one
        might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of
        his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had
        a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author;
        insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the
        mysteries he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to
        strain the obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in
        fustian; a fault for which he was remarkable in his original
        writings, as in the tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise, &amp;c. In a word,
        the nature of the man may account for his whole performance; for he
        appears, from his preface and remarks, to have been of an arrogant
        turn, and an enthusiast in poetry. His own boast, of having finished
        half the Iliad in less than fifteen weeks, shows with what negligence
        his version was performed. But that which is to be allowed him, and
        which very much contributed to cover his defects, is a daring fiery
        spirit that animates his translation, which is something like what
        one might imagine Homer himself would have writ before he arrived at
        years of discretion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hobbes has given
        us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but for particulars
        and circumstances he continually lops them, and often omits the most
        beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close translation, I doubt not
        many have been led into that error by the shortness of it, which
        proceeds not from his following the original line by line, but from
        the contractions above mentioned. He sometimes omits whole similes
        and sentences; and is now and then guilty of mistakes, into which no
        writer of his learning could have fallen, but through carelessness.
        His poetry, as well as Ogilby's, is too mean for criticism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a great loss
        to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live to translate the
        Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small part of the
        sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the
        sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be excused on
        account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to have had
        too much regard to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies, and has
        unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the
        original. However, had he translated the whole work, I would no more
        have attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of whom
        (notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited
        translation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses is
        like<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlv">[pg xlv]</span><a name=
        "Pgxlv" id="Pgxlv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that of great
        ministers: though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth
        of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the
        head of it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That which, in my
        opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates Homer,
        is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes
        his chief character: in particular places, where the sense can bear
        any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most
        agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of
        his style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve,
        in the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in
        the more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the
        speeches, a fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness
        and gravity; not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the
        words, nor sometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit
        nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he ought
        to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done
        by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or
        poetry. What I would further recommend to him is, to study his author
        rather from his own text, than from any commentaries, how learned
        soever, or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the
        world; to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above
        all the ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these,
        the Archbishop of Cambray's Telemachus may give him the truest idea
        of the spirit and turn of our author; and Bossu's admirable Treatise
        of the Epic Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But
        after all, with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or
        with whatever happiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to
        please but a few; those only who have at once a taste of poetry, and
        competent learning. For to satisfy such a want either, is not in the
        nature of this undertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing
        that is not modern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What I have done
        is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am prepared to
        learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets, who are
        most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst, whatever
        they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as they are
        unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was guided in
        this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and by
        persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be
        true, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to
        men of wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to
        undertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that
        occasion in such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity. I was
        obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my
        undertaking to the public. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that
        warmth with which he always serves his friend. The humanity and
        frankness of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never knew wanting on any
        occasion. I must also acknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many
        friendly offices, as well as sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who
        had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer. I must add the
        names of Mr. Rowe, and Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a further
        opportunity of doing justice to the last, whose good nature
        (to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexlvi">[pg xlvi]</span><a name=
        "Pgxlvi" id="Pgxlvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> give it a great
        panegyric), is no less extensive than his learning. The favour of
        these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so
        true an affection. But what can I say of the honour so many of the
        great have done me; while the first names of the age appear as my
        subscribers, and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of
        learning as my chief encouragers? Among these it is a particular
        pleasure to me to find, that my highest obligations are to such who
        have done most honour to the name of poet: that his grace the Duke of
        Buckingham was not displeased I should undertake the author to whom
        he has given (in his excellent Essay), so complete a praise:</p>

        Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it is hard to say
        whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his
        generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord Bolingbroke,
        not more distinguished in the great scenes of business, than in all
        the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not refused to be
        the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their writer: and that
        the noble author of the tragedy of "Heroic Love" has continued his
        partiality to me, from my writing pastorals to my attempting the
        Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing, that I have had
        the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general,
        but their correction of several particulars of this translation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I could say a
        great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the Earl of
        Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous
        action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them.
        Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my desire
        of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair. The
        particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord Chancellor)
        gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his friendship.
        I must attribute to the same motive that of several others of my
        friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the
        privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can no
        way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In short, I have
        found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would have thought
        himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that has been
        shown me by its learned rival, the University of Oxford. And I can
        hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when I
        reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy
        friendships, which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is
        the more to be acknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has
        never gratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities
        of particular men. Whatever the success may prove, I shall never
        repent of an undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and
        friendship of so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass
        some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of
        follies, after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor
        disagreeable to myself.</p>

        ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the war of
        Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring towns, and
        taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseis and Briseis,
        allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles. Chryses,
        the father of Chryseis, and priest of Apollo, comes to the Grecian
        camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in the
        tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently
        dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who
        inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and
        encourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to
        the refusal of Chryseis. The king, being obliged to send back his
        captive, enters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor
        pacifies; however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he
        seizes on Briseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws
        himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining
        to Thetis, she supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the
        wrong done to her son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter,
        granting her suit, incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high,
        till they are reconciled by the address of Vulcan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time of
        two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during the plague,
        one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve for
        Jupiter's stay with the Æthiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers
        her petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to
        Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">THE TRIAL OF THE
        ARMY, AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jupiter, in
        pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful vision to
        Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle, in order to
        make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. The general, who
        is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance, but
        fears the army was discouraged by his absence, and the late plague,
        as well as by the length of time, contrives to make trial of their
        disposition by a stratagem. He first communicates his design to the
        princes in council, that he would propose a return to the soldiers,
        and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced.
        Then he assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a return to
        Greece, they unanimously agree to it, and run to prepare the ships.
        They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises the
        insolence of Thersites. The assembly is recalled, several speeches
        made on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed,
        which was to make a general muster of the troops, and to divide them
        into their several nations, before they proceeded to battle. This
        gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks
        and Trojans, and in a large catalogue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time employed
        in this book consists not entirely of one day. The scene lies in the
        Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end it removes to
        Troy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">THE DUEL OF
        MENELAUS AND PARIS.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The armies being
        ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon between Menelaus and
        Paris (by the intervention of Hector) for the determination of the
        war. Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the fight. She leads her to
        the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his counsellers observing the
        Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom Helen gives an account of
        the chief of them. The kings on either part take the solemn oath for
        the conditions of the combat. The duel ensues; wherein Paris being
        overcome, he is snatched away in a cloud by Venus, and transported to
        his apartment. She then calls Helen from the walls, and brings the
        lovers together. Agamemnon, on the part of the Grecians, demands the
        restoration of Helen, and the performance of the articles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">ARGUMENT.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">THE BREACH OF THE
        TRUCE, AND THE FIRST BATTLE.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gods
        deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agree upon the
        continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break the
        truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is
        wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the meantime some of the Trojan
        troops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts
        of a good general; he reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders,
        some by praises and others by reproof. Nestor is particularly
        celebrated for his military discipline. The battle joins, and great
        numbers are slain on both sides.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same day
        continues through this as through the last book (as it does also
        through the two following, and almost to the end of the seventh
        book). The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.</p>
